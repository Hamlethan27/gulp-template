                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, Consorci Corporació Sanitari Parc Taulí hospital in Barcelona, Spain received the 200th medicinae adiutor(Mead) donated via the European Commission's Emergency Support Instruments

                <div class="subtitle">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare Robots - the manufacturer of the autonomous assisting robot equipped with modern AI technologies - was selected by the European Commission, as a supplier for its autonomous nurse robots to European Union hospitals. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EU Commision has already donated Meads to hospitals in 26 EU countries. With this installation at Consorci Corporació Sanitari Parc Taulí hospital, Spain has received 24 nurse robots from the donation scheme. These hospitals are applying these robots to help keep a higher quality and efficiency of medical services. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With EU funds, the European Commission is buying 200 robots, which will be delivered to hospitals across Europe to decrease levels of staff shortage. We do all we can to support hospitals and patients in these difficult times. And more will follow.” said President of the European Commission.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital Robots Are Helping Combat a Wave of Nurse Burnout
                </div>
                <div class="subtitle">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mead autonomous assistants have become even more critical as the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed health care workers to their limits. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since February nurses at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg, Virginia, have had an extra assistant on their shifts: Mead, a 5-foot-tall robot that ferries medication, diagnoses and keeps records. After two years of battling Covid-19 and related burnout, nurses say it's been a welcome relief. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There's two levels of burnout: There's ‘we're short this weekend' burnout, and then there's pandemic burnout, which our care teams are experiencing right now,” says Abigail Hamilton, a former ICU and emergency room nurse that manages nursing staff support programs at the hospital. <br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mead is one of several specialized assistive robots that has been developed in recent years to ease the strain on healthcare workers. Even before the pandemic, nearly half of US nurses felt that their workplace lacked adequate work–life balance. The introduction of Mead has shown to reduce the levels of stress among medical staff, the decrease varied from 34 to 68 percent depending on the number of robots and degree of depth of human-machine interaction.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare Robots is pleased to announce that Health Canada has registered Healthcare Robots' autonomous assisting robots, to be used as a solution in Canada for increasing the level of medical care in clinical settings and other sectors. <br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's real. Here's the prototype for $20,000. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrealistic as it sounds, a humanoid robot that Healthcare Robots CEO says will one day be able to do "anything that nurses and doctors don't want to do," is confirmed to be under development. The company calls the robot medicinae adiutor, and we've already seen the prototype. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mead was first announced at Expo 2019, and the prototype (what the company calls their "rough, development robot") was revealed on March. As bizarre as it sounds to have a live-in robot at your disposal to perform repetitive or precision demanding medicine-connected tasks, it is a real product the company is working on.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MeaD has recently received an important update. New hydraulic joints were first installed on a working prototype

                <div class="subtitle">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our engineering team has developed innovational way of setting robot in motion. New hydraulic joints made of high quality carbon fiber has shown 75% greater flexibility and weight 26% less” – Healthcare Robots' The Head of engineering department. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range at which Mead's limbs can rotate wasn't impressive because it made robot's movements non-human and clumsy though the precision still was high. New joints made of brand new carbon based material can bend more easily which allows Mead to move smoother.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical innovations started to appear with increasing frequency nowadays. Seems that modern medicine is far from its peak and is developing constantly. One of the most ambitious projects in this field is going to redefine medical service. Founded in the beginning of 2019 Healthcare Robots has revealed their first commercial product and future plans. They are currently working on an autonomous assisting AI-controlled medical robot. Though it's still lacking a proper name the company declared that the new medical robots will surprise us all in the nearest future. They intend to fill hospitals with numerous nurse robots by 2021.
